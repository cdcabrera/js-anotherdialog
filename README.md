<h1>JS.Another Dialog</h1>
<p>
    Yet another JS dialog/modal. Except this time around I used native Promises through the exposed methods. 
    Meaning as long as you return a Promise you can have as many asynchronous calls as you want and the chained methods
    will fire in sequence. As a first round I tested the idea with jQuery.Deferred.

<p>
    Working on it... but mostly awesomenessâ€™ness.

<h2>Browser compatibility</h2>
<p>
    In testing...
